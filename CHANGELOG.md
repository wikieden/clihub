# Changelog

All notable changes to `@wikieden/clihub`. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions are published to
npm on each `vX.Y.Z` tag.

## [1.41.0] — `clihub apply` MCP now uses the fixed path/dialect

End-to-end testing of `clihub apply` against real CLIs: apply had its *own*
copy of the MCP-writing logic (`~/.claude/settings.json`, no http dialect), so
it never picked up the v1.38/v1.40 fixes — `apply` reported `mcp foo@claude-code`
but wrote it where Claude Code can't read it.

- `runApply` now delegates MCP to the shared `addMcp` (single source of truth):
  Claude Code → `~/.claude.json`, Gemini → `~/.gemini/settings.json` with the
  right http/sse shape and command/args splitting. Removed the duplicate map.
- Verified end-to-end: after `clihub apply`, real `claude mcp list` shows the
  server (previously: nothing). Suite 94/94.

## [1.40.0] — fix HTTP MCP shape per CLI (gemini httpUrl)

Real-CLI testing: HTTP/SSE MCP entries differ by CLI. Gemini's own docs require
`{ httpUrl }` for streamable HTTP and `{ url }` for SSE — *no* `type` field
(precedence httpUrl > url > command). clihub wrote `{ type:'http', url }` for
both CLIs, so Gemini saw the `url` key and treated an HTTP server as SSE.

- JsonMcpAdapter gained a `dialect` ('claude' | 'gemini'). Gemini http →
  `{ httpUrl }`, sse → `{ url }`; Claude Code stays `{ type, url }`.
- Verified in container: `mcp add --url … --transport http` writes
  `{"httpUrl":…}` for gemini and `{"type":"http","url":…}` for claude. Suite 94/94.

This completes the MCP correctness pass (location, command split, http shape).

## [1.39.0] — fix inline MCP command splitting

`clihub mcp add foo --command "npx -y @scope/server /path"` stored the whole
string as `command`, so the CLI tried to exec a binary literally named
`npx -y @scope/server /path` (ENOENT). Now the inline command is split into
`command` + `args[]` (catalog MCPs already store them separately, so they were
unaffected).

- Verified in container: `clihub mcp add` then real `claude mcp list` shows
  `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp` as a proper command.
  Suite 93/93.

## [1.38.0] — fix Claude Code MCP location (.claude.json)

Real-CLI testing: `clihub mcp add` wrote Claude Code's MCP server into
`~/.claude/settings.json`, but Claude Code reads user-scope MCP from
`~/.claude.json` (verified: `claude mcp add --scope user` reports
`File modified: ~/.claude.json`). So every MCP server clihub added for Claude
Code was silently invisible to Claude.

- `mcp add` / `mcp list` / `mcp remove` (and `clihub apply`) now target
  `~/.claude.json` for Claude Code. Gemini stays `~/.gemini/settings.json`.
- Verified end-to-end in container: after `clihub mcp add`, the real
  `claude mcp list` now shows the server. Suite 92/92.

## [1.37.0] — fix Codex skill install (Agent-Skills dir layout)

Real-CLI testing: Codex auto-discovers Agent Skills under
`~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (a directory per skill, same standard as
Claude Code — confirmed in the Codex binary's own strings). clihub wrote a flat
`~/.codex/skills/<id>.md`, which Codex did not discover.

- CodexSkillAdapter now writes `~/.codex/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` (+ `manifest.json`),
  reusing the shared `renderSkillMd` so Codex and Claude Code produce the same
  layout. `install` cleans up the legacy flat `.md`. 3 new tests. Suite 90/90.

Verified in container against real codex 0.135.0.

## [1.36.0] — fix Gemini skill install (TOML, not Markdown)

Real-CLI testing: `skill install --tool gemini-cli` wrote
`~/.gemini/commands/<id>.md`. Gemini CLI **only loads `.toml` custom commands**
(confirmed in its own bundled docs — TOML with a required `prompt` field), so
the `.md` file was silently ignored — the skill never became a usable command.

- GeminiCliSkillAdapter now writes a valid `<id>.toml` (`description` + a
  multiline-literal `prompt`), so it loads as `/<id>`. `uninstall` also cleans
  up any legacy `.md`. 3 new tests assert the TOML parses with a `prompt`.

Verified in container against real gemini 0.44.1.

## [1.35.0] — honest per-CLI proxy caveat

Real-CLI testing of proxy injection: clihub writes the proxy into a CLI's
settings `env`. That is applied directly by **Claude Code** (its `settings.json`
`env` block feeds the session). **Codex** uses `shell_environment_policy` + the
process's shell environment — its `config.toml` has no proxy-applying `env`
table — and most other CLIs likewise read `HTTPS_PROXY` from the shell.

- `proxy set --tool <x>` now prints a caveat for non-Claude-Code tools: the
  proxy was written to the config, but if it doesn't take effect, also
  `export HTTPS_PROXY=…` in the shell. No false promise that every CLI reads
  its config `env`.

## [1.34.0] — fix Goose install hang; verify Cursor

More real-install testing of every supported CLI in the container.

- **Goose `tool install` could hang.** The official script ends by running the
  interactive `goose configure` (asks for a provider + key), which stalls a
  non-interactive `clihub tool install`. Now pipes to `CONFIGURE=false bash` —
  installs the binary only; users configure goose separately. Verified
  end-to-end: `Goose ✓ installed 1.36.0`.
- **Cursor verified correct** — `curl https://cursor.com/install | bash`,
  command `cursor-agent`, config `~/.cursor/cli-config.json` all match a real
  install (2026.05.28). No change needed.
- Claude Code / Gemini / Codex already confirmed real via npm.

## [1.33.0] — fix Kiro CLI install + detection

Caught by installing the real Kiro CLI in the container test env.

- **Install method was wrong** (brew cask / "download from kiro.dev"). The
  official installer is `curl -fsSL https://cli.kiro.dev/install | bash`
  (macOS + Linux, non-interactive on a fresh install). `tool install kiro-cli`
  now runs it.
- **Detection was broken**: the command is `kiro-cli` (installs into
  `~/.local/bin`, alongside `kiro-cli-chat` / `kiro-cli-term`), not `kiro`.
  clihub looked for `kiro`, so it reported Kiro as not-installed even when it
  was. Now detects `kiro-cli` — verified against real `kiro-cli 2.5.0`.

## [1.32.0] — no more dead-end output

Container testing surfaced two spots where clihub gave a bare result with no
next step:

- **`search` with no hits** now explains the search scope and points to
  `clihub recommend` / `clihub --help` instead of a lone "No matches".
- **`mcp list`** prints a footer clarifying that unified MCP management covers
  the JSON-config CLIs (Claude Code & Gemini) — so the absence of the others
  isn't a silent mystery.

## [1.31.0] — auto-backup is now opt-in

Following real-machine testing, config auto-backup no longer runs silently by
default — users shouldn't accumulate hidden snapshots they didn't ask for.

- **Off by default. Opt in** with `clihub config set backup.auto true`
  (persistent) or `CLIHUB_BACKUP=1` (per-session). `CLIHUB_NO_BACKUP=1` still
  hard-disables. `clihub config restore <tool>` is unchanged.
- **Scope (by design):** auto-backup covers each CLI's *settings* file (proxy,
  env, base URL…). Skill and plugin installs write separate files and are not
  snapshotted — undo those with `clihub skill uninstall` / `plugin uninstall`.

## [1.30.0] — config auto-backup + one-command rollback

Every change clihub makes to a CLI's settings is now reversible:

- **Auto-backup on write.** Before any clihub-caused settings change (proxy,
  skill install, profile switch, wizard, apply…), the current file is
  snapshotted to `~/.clihub/settings-backups/<key>/`. Single chokepoint —
  both the JSON and TOML adapters. No-op when nothing changed; keeps the last
  10 per file; opt out with `CLIHUB_NO_BACKUP=1`. Snapshots live *outside* each
  CLI's own config dir, so the host CLI never sees stray `.bak` files.
- **`clihub config backups [tool]`** — list snapshots for one or all CLIs.
- **`clihub config restore <tool>`** — roll back the last change. The restore
  itself is snapshotted, so running it again flips back.

## [1.29.0] — non-TTY no longer crashes

Round 2 of the beginner's-eye audit:

- **`clihub` and `clihub wizard` no longer crash without a terminal.** Both
  paths used @clack prompts that throw `ERR_TTY_INIT_FAILED` when stdin/stdout
  aren't a TTY (piped output, CI, `clihub | cat`). They now detect the missing
  TTY and print a friendly pointer (`clihub --help` / `clihub init`), exit 1.
- **`config show` / `proxy show` paths** shrink to `~/…` for readability.

## [1.28.0] — newcomer fixes

First-impression polish from a beginner's-eye audit:

- **Typos no longer crash.** An unknown command (`clihub instll`) now prints
  `unknown command` + a `did you mean clihub install?` suggestion and exits 1,
  instead of falling through to the TUI and throwing `ERR_TTY_INIT_FAILED`.
- **`--help` greets newcomers** — a banner up top points to `clihub wizard`.
- **`doctor` reads friendlier** — paths shrink to `~/…` and a fresh machine
  shows `(not set up)` / `Not configured yet (run clihub wizard)` instead of
  the alarming `missing`.

## [1.27.0] — doctor shows proxy

- `clihub doctor` now has a **PROXY column** (each CLI's injected proxy)
  and prints the **detected system/terminal proxy** above the table.
  `--json` includes `systemProxy` + per-CLI `proxies`. One place to see
  health + network. Caps the proxy work (v1.23–v1.27).

## [1.26.0] — GitHub star nudge

- On TUI exit / after the wizard, clihub occasionally (20%) asks you to
  star it on GitHub — **Enter opens the repo in your browser, Esc skips**.
  Capped + remembered in `~/.clihub/nudge.json` (stops after you open it or
  3 asks); never shown in CI / non-TTY / with `CLIHUB_NO_NUDGE`.
- core `shouldNudgeStar` / `markNudged` (pure, tested).

## [1.25.0] — detect system proxy

- clihub now **detects the system / terminal proxy** (env `HTTPS_PROXY`
  etc., then macOS `scutil --proxy`) and **pre-fills** it in the wizard and
  the TUI "Set proxy" prompt — no retyping or typos.
- `clihub proxy show` displays the detected system proxy and its source.
- core `detectSystemProxy` / `parseScutilProxy` (pure, tested).

## [1.24.0] — proxy consistency

- The setup wizard's proxy step now **injects into each selected CLI**
  (per-CLI settings env), not just clihub's global config.
- `clihub proxy show` now lists the per-CLI proxy for every provider
  alongside the global setting.

## [1.23.0] — per-CLI proxy

- Each CLI's TUI submenu gets a **Set proxy** entry that shows the current
  proxy and writes `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` (+ `ALL_PROXY` for socks)
  into that CLI's own settings `env` — so the CLI actually uses it. Blank
  clears it.
- `clihub proxy set <url> --tool <id>` now really injects per-CLI (was a
  no-op label before); `proxy unset --tool <id>` clears it. Without
  `--tool`, proxy stays global (clihub's own requests).
- core `setToolProxy` / `getToolProxy` / `applyProxyEnv` (pure, tested).

## [1.22.0] — show preset contents

- `clihub preset list` now prints each preset's tools + full skill list, and
  the wizard preset picker shows `N skills: ...` in the hint — newcomers
  can see what a preset bundles before choosing.

## [1.21.0] — wizard: per-CLI skill selection

- The setup wizard can now pick a **different skill set for each selected
  CLI** (multiselect per CLI) instead of one global preset. Choices become
  tool-scoped `clihub.yaml` skill entries (`- id: <skill>` + `tool: <cli>`).
- `generateClihubYaml` skills accept `{ id, tool }` objects; new
  `WizardAnswers.perToolSkills`. Completes the wizard fill list.

## [1.20.0] — wizard: multiple keys per account

- The setup wizard now stores **multiple API keys per account profile**
  (loop "add another key?" per profile) instead of one. Each key →
  `clihub auth set` in that profile's keychain.

## [1.19.0] — project scaffold files

- `clihub init --scaffold` (and a wizard step) writes neutral project
  starter files — `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.github/workflows/clihub.yml`
  — never overwriting an existing file. Agent memory files stay owned by
  `clihub memory generate`.

## [1.18.0] — wizard in the menu + run a CLI

- The setup wizard is now re-runnable from the TUI main menu (🧙 Setup
  wizard), not just `clihub wizard` — newcomers can revisit setup anytime.
  Wizard flow extracted to `wizard-flow.ts` so command + menu share it.
- Each installed CLI's submenu gains a **▶ Run** entry that launches the
  CLI (stdio inherited; exit returns to clihub).

## [1.17.0] — clihub wizard (first-run setup)

- `clihub wizard` — one guided flow for newcomers: select + install CLIs,
  pick a preset, configure a proxy (HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5), create multiple
  account profiles each with an API key, and emit `clihub.yaml` +
  `clihub.schema.json` + a `clihub.memory.md` template. `--dry-run` shows
  the plan first.
- core `planWizard` (pure, tested) turns answers into the clihub.yaml +
  an ordered action list; `memoryTemplate`.
- Skeleton: project scaffold files (AGENTS.md/.editorconfig/…) and
  multiple keys per account are stubbed for a follow-up release.

## [1.16.0] — clihub init upgrade

- `clihub init --from-installed` infers `tools` (the CLIs already on this
  machine) and `skills` (from `recommend`) so the scaffolded `clihub.yaml`
  fits your setup out of the box.
- `clihub init --schema` adds a `# yaml-language-server: $schema=...` header
  and writes `clihub.schema.json` for editor autocomplete.
- core `generateClihubYaml` / `scaffoldFromInstalled` (reused, tested).

## [1.15.0] — grow the MCP catalog

- Six more official MCP servers: `postgres`, `sqlite`, `git`, `gitlab`,
  `slack`, `brave-search` (14 total). Improves `recommend` matches and the
  `mcp add` menu.
- MCP integrity test: every entry must be launchable (command or url),
  declare `supports`, and have a unique id.

## [1.14.0] — grow the catalog

- Five new batteries-included presets: `python`, `go`, `rust` (language
  dev bundles), `research` (web search + synthesis + planning), `devops`
  (deploy/security/performance/git). 8 presets total.
- New catalog-integrity test: every preset's skill ids must exist in
  `skills.json` and tool ids must be known providers — guards against
  dangling references.

## [1.13.0] — clihub mcp

- `clihub mcp <list|add|remove> [id]` manages MCP servers across the
  JSON-`mcpServers` CLIs (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) in one command. `add`
  resolves from the catalog or takes inline `--command` / `--url`
  (`--transport`); `list` shows installed servers per CLI; `remove` clears
  them. Orchestrates the same JsonMcpAdapter `clihub apply` uses.

## [1.12.0] — clihub diff

- `clihub diff <a> [b]` diffs two `clihub.lock.json` files (b defaults to
  `./clihub.lock.json`): tools added / removed / upgraded / downgraded
  (numeric version compare), plus skills / MCP / plugins presence changes.
  `--json` for tooling. Pure + read-only.

## [1.11.0] — profile shell hook

- `clihub profile hook <bash|zsh|fish>` emits a shell hook that auto-runs
  `clihub profile use <name>` when you `cd` into a directory whose
  `clihub.yaml` names a `profile:` (tracked via `CLIHUB_ACTIVE_PROFILE`,
  read with sed — no clihub spawn per prompt). Completes the v0.5.2
  deferred per-project auto-switch.

## [1.10.0] — clihub recommend

- `clihub recommend [--json]` suggests skills / presets / MCP from two
  read-only signals: which CLIs are installed + what the current project
  looks like (cwd files → tags: frontend / python / docker / git / ...).
  Each suggestion carries a reason and a ready-to-run command. Advisory
  and non-writing. (MCP items point at the TUI until `clihub mcp install`
  lands in v1.12.)

## [1.9.0] — onboarding polish + quality pass

Individual/newcomer-focused line.

- **First-run guidance:** `clihub` TUI now detects an empty machine and
  shows a welcome note + a top-level "🚀 Quick start" option that applies
  the `starter` preset (Claude Code + 5 core skills) in one step.
- `clihub doctor` prints a get-started hint (`preset apply starter` /
  `clihub`) when no CLI is installed.
- **Quality (internal):** `bun test` suite expanded to 33 tests / 10 files
  — i18n key-set parity guard (en/zh-CN/ja/ko/es), plus IO coverage for
  status / conformance / memory. CI `unit` job runs them on push/PR.

## [1.8.0] — auth login --browser (PKCE)

- `clihub auth login <provider> --browser` implements OAuth Authorization
  Code + PKCE (RFC 7636) over a 127.0.0.1 loopback redirect, for providers
  without a device flow. CSPRNG `state` (CSRF protection, verified on
  redirect), S256 code challenge, loopback bound to localhost and closed
  in `finally`. Security-reviewed (1 HIGH fixed: state now uses
  `crypto.randomBytes`). Completes the three login modes:
  device grant / PKCE browser / refresh.

## [1.7.0] — clihub conformance

- `clihub conformance [dir] [--json]` validates a catalog against the
  published specs: manifest + sha256 integrity, JSON parse, declarative
  provider specs, signature status (unsigned = soft warning), optional
  `clihub.lock.json` v1. Read-only; the machine-checkable basis for a
  `clihub-compatible` badge. Exits non-zero when not conformant.

## [1.6.0] — auth login --refresh

- `clihub auth login <provider> --refresh` re-mints an access token from
  the stored `refresh_token` (RFC 6749 §6 refresh grant) with no browser —
  the token-expiry-recovery half of unified auth. Rotates the refresh
  token when the provider returns a new one; rewrites the native
  credential file (0600).

## [1.5.0] — clihub auth login

- `clihub auth login <provider>` implements the OAuth 2.0 Device
  Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) — headless/CI-friendly, no browser
  redirect. Vendor specifics (endpoints, client id, scope) are BYO config
  in `~/.clihub/auth-providers.json`; the token is written to the CLI's
  native credential file (0600, atomic). Honours
  `authorization_pending` / `slow_down`, bounded by the device-code
  deadline. Security-reviewed: no token material logged, parent dir 0700,
  provider strings sanitized before printing.

## [1.4.0] — clihub pack

- `clihub pack <docker|brew|scoop> [--out file]` generates distribution
  manifests (Dockerfile / Homebrew formula / Scoop manifest) for the
  current version. Reach beyond npm; pure generation, no new deps.
  (brew carries a `__FILL_SHA256__` placeholder for the tap maintainer.)

## [1.3.0] — clihub auth status

- `clihub auth status [--json]` reports cross-CLI login + token-expiry
  visibility — a best-effort, read-only inspection of each CLI's
  credential file (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini), showing logged-in /
  expiring / expired without printing token contents. First slice of
  unified auth (GH #33811 / #34306); a full OAuth login flow follows.

## [1.2.0] — clihub team

- `clihub team <add|list|pull|use|push|rm>` shares a reproducible
  toolchain through a plain git repo (cloned into `~/.clihub/team/<name>`).
  `push` commits `clihub.yaml` / `clihub.lock.json` / `clihub.memory.md` /
  `clihub.schema.json`; `use` pulls them into a project. No clihub-specific
  backend; team config is unencrypted (sign the catalog for authenticity).

## [1.1.0] — clihub ci

- `clihub ci [github|gitlab] [--out file] [--node]` generates a CI
  workflow that validates `clihub.yaml` (`apply --plan`) on every push,
  with commented opt-ins for `memory generate --check` and
  `status --strict`. Pure generation, no new dependencies.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-29

First stable release. clihub is now a complete, vendor-neutral manager for
multiple AI coding CLIs: install them, keep their skills/MCP/plugins in
sync, pin and roll back versions, carry config across machines, and gate
CI on a shared lockfile.

Stable surface (no breaking changes planned without a major bump):
`clihub.yaml` schema v1, `clihub.lock.json` v1, the `@clihub/core` public
API, and the `clihub` CLI command set.

## [0.12.0] — clihub schema

- `clihub schema [--out file]` emits a draft-07 JSON Schema for
  `clihub.yaml`, enabling autocomplete + inline validation via the YAML
  language server (`# yaml-language-server: $schema=...`).

## [0.11.0] — clihub status

- `clihub status [--json] [--strict]` checks this machine against the
  pinned `clihub.lock.json` (ok / drift / missing / unlocked). `--strict`
  exits non-zero for CI drift gates.
- `clihub lock` now also resolves declarative providers.

## [0.10.0] — declarative provider SDK

- Teach clihub a new AI CLI with a JSON spec (`~/.clihub/providers.json`
  or a catalog `providers.json`) — detection + npm/bun/brew install, no
  code or fork. `clihub provider list|add|remove`.
- Shell-command installs gated behind `--allow-scripts`; built-in
  providers cannot be shadowed.

## [0.9.0] — signed catalogs

- ed25519 catalog signing (`catalog keygen` / `sign`) + a local trust
  store (`catalog trust add --source`). `catalog verify` now checks both
  sha256 integrity and publisher authenticity. Pure `node:crypto`.

## [0.8.0] — clihub sync

- `clihub sync export|import`: cross-machine, end-to-end-encrypted config
  bundle (global config + catalog sources + profile metadata). scrypt +
  AES-256-GCM, passphrase-only, zero backend.

## [0.7.0] — clihub memory

- `clihub memory generate`: one source (`clihub.memory.md` → `AGENTS.md`
  → `CLAUDE.md`) fans out to `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` /
  `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` / `.goosehints` / `.kiro/steering/*.md`.
  Managed-block markers preserve hand-edits; `--check` for CI.

## [0.6.1] — clihub apply + lockfile

- `clihub apply [--plan]`, `clihub lock`, `clihub install --frozen`:
  converge a machine to `clihub.yaml`, pin to `clihub.lock.json`.

## [0.6.0] — federation + more CLIs

- Multi-source catalog federation (`catalog add`), Cursor + Goose
  providers (6 CLIs total), HTTP/SSE MCP transport.

## [0.5.x]

- `watch` / `search` / shell completion / man; proxy + CA bundle;
  `doctor --fix` + error codes; multi-account profiles + keychain vault +
  per-profile `BASE_URL` injection; per-tool version pin/rollback; skill
  audit.

## [0.1.0 – 0.4.0]

- Providers (Claude Code / Codex / Kiro / Gemini), 30 skills, presets,
  cross-tool skill fan-out, i18n, per-CLI TUI, MCP catalog, agentskills.io
  SKILL.md installer, plugin install, remote catalog sync with sha256,
  Codex TOML, Windows-safe paths.
